# Feature: Export Symptoms File

As a patient,  
I want to export my symptoms file,  
So that I can present it to a medical specialist during my visit  

## UX Design & Wireframes

## Rule: The export can only be done if all symptoms have been checked.

#### Example: Export is blocked if body temperature not checked 

#### Example: Export is blocked if personal health info missing

## Rule: The export can be in different file formats

#### Examples: The export can be done in 
| format                 | generated file |
|------------------------|----------------|
| portable document file | export.pdf     |
| microsoft excel        | export.xls     |
